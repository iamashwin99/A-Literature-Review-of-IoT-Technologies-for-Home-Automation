Healthcare oriented Intelligent Home Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The technology of Smart Homes (SH), as an instance of ambient assisted living
 technologies, is designed to assist the homes’ residents accomplishing
 their daily-living activities and thus having a better quality of life
 while preserving their privacy.
 The smart home is equipped with a collection of software and hardware component
s put together to monitor the living space, and infer/understand the behavior
 of itsd rexisfents while preserving privacy.

\begin_layout Standard
Rise of aged population and the following need of supporting healthcare
 systems that are dependable and affordable.
 Elderly homes also face huge financial pressures ,being responsible for
 providing formal care as well as healthcare services to the residents individua
lly.
 Statistically, the healthcare costs are almost similar between hospitals
 and care-homes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Smart Homes technology is considered as a way to reduce living and care
 costs and is also looked up to as a technological panacea for improving
 the quality of living for people with care needs.
 It has been applied for many purposes (Miskelly 2001)

 like energy saving, security and safety, fall detection, light management,
 smoke and fire detection etc.
 using various solutions such as video monitoring, alarms, smart planners
 and calendars, reminders, etc.
 Equipped with sensors, actuators and eventually cameras to collect different
 types of data about the home and the residents, Smart-Home can enable automatic
 systems or caregivers to control the environment on behalf of the residents,
 predict their actions and track their health condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each layer of the system has its own function and comes with its own challenges
 to be dealt with.
 Data is collected as the physical layer by sensors, transmitted through
 the communication layer to the processing unit in the processing layer
 where it is analysed for activity recognition and behaviour patterns discovery.
 The outcome of the analysis in the form of specific information, alerts
 or warnings may be communicated through the interface layer to various
 stakeholders (resident, caregivers, resident’s relatives).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sensors and Networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are the Hardware component of the entire Intelligent Home system,
 and involve integration of sensors and associated actuators within a single
 network that represents the home as a Virtual System over the Internet.
 Many communication technologies and protocols to integrate the home devices
 and sensors in the home are available such as Bluetooth, ZigBee and PLC.
 Sensors provide data as either discrete or continuous data states/streams,
 largely depending on the environmental factors and activity being monitored.
 In particular sensors have commonly been seen to capture the following
 data : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
– Strain and pressure

\begin_layout Description
– Position, direction, distance and motion 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
– Light, radiation, temperature and humidity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
– Type of material (e.g., solid, liquid and gas) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\begin_layout Standard
Simple state sensors that can return a binary output of an event happening
 such as opening and closing of doors, detecting motion in an area/room
 and accordingly notifying the smart-home system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commonly used sensors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Passive-Infrared Sensors (PIR): Used to detect motion,can be used to identify
 occupancy-status of rooms and is commonly part of security systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Contact-Switch Sensors: Typical use to find open/close state of doors like
 cabinets,fridge.
 Packaged with pressure sensors, can be used to detect occupancy such as
 when a person sits on a chair in a room.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Radio Frequency Identification(RFID): Identify object-tags or people with
 unique IDs and reading any associated data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Intelligent system can attempt to infer what activities the resident
 is performing, by inferring from a combination of these discrete parameters
 and identify abnormal behaviour.
 Such as cooking may be inferred by detecting occupants in the kitchen coupled
 with opening and closing of the fridge door

) was proposed to assist the elderly with dementia through the process of
 washing hands.
 COACH uses video frames to discover the hand position relying on the partially
 observable Markov decision processing model (POMDP).
 The system features a multimedia guide and also alerts the caregivers when
 the person is in a risky situation as identified by the system (e.g., when
 the person is not moving, the sink is full)

Data and Knowledge Engineering: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the part of an Intelligent Home System and any other Internet-of-Thing
 enabled technology that gives them the power of cognition and intelligent
 behaviour.
 All Internet-of-Thing applications collect tonnes of data which is then
 sent to servers/cloud for data processing and analysis.
 Prior to analysis, the data undergoes Pre-Processing and Cleansing that
 may be performed locally(Edge computing) or at the cloud.
 After the data is prepared, analysis is done to classify,interpret activities
 like- mining behavioral patterns, recognizing activities, detecting abnormal
 behaviour etc.
 After analysis, Intelligent home takes decisions and performs actions according
ly such as sending alerts,booking appointments etc.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Decision Tree
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This approach aims to model the relationships between the input data and
 the resulting output.
 Used for classification purposes with discrete outputs by use of class
 labels.
 The logic-structure consists of nodes that represent features and branches
 that represent the values of the features.
 The leaf nodes represent the class labels The resultant trees are used
 to create Rules, that the Smart-Home system can use to classify the current-sta
te of residents as safe or at potential risk by calculating the class labels.
 Such a system is also known as Rule-Based-System(RBS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Trees can be built through an induction process by running algorithms on
 a dataset.
 Some known algorithms used are - TDIDT/ID3, C4.5, CART, MARS, and CHAID.
 Trees can be generated by recursive algorithms that grow the tree and algorithm
s that prune the tree dynamically.
 Algorithms like C4.5 and CART employ both: growing and pruning of the tree.
 It is important to note that the accuracy of any algorithm is not absolute,
 but rather varies case-to-case basis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In Prossegger and Bouchachia (2014)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

- the authors applied decision trees to model activities of daily living
 in a multi-resident context.
 An extension of ID5R, called EID5R, was proposed where the leaf nodes are
 multi-labeled.
 E-ID5R induces a decision tree incrementally to accommodate new instances
 and new activities as they become available over time.
 To evaluate the proposed algorithm, the ARAS dataset which is a real-world
 multi resident dataset stemming from two houses was used.
 E-ID5R performs differently on activities of both houses: for house A whose
 data is quite challenging, the classification rate was modest (40 %), while
 for house B the rate approached 82 %.

 - Focused on differentiating an individual’s movement activities such as
 walking, moving over stairs, running, and even brushing their teeth.
 The device employed were wearable sensors such as accelerometers.
 It was observed that C4.5 achieved 97.29 % when trained and tested on data
 from the same user over many days.
 An accuracy of 98.53 % was achieved when C4.5 was trained and tested on data
 stemming from many users and over many days and 77.95 % when trained and
 tested on data not from the same day.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fuzzy Logic 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fuzzy set as ‘‘a class of objects with a continuum grades of membership”.
 Such a set is characterized by a member-mapping which assigns a value in
 the continuous interval from 0 to 1, that denotes how closely related are
 the objects.
 Fuzzy sets and logic by Zadeh (1965)

\end_inset

 was an expansion to the classical set theory.
 In this manner, Fuzzy Logic is a method of reasoning that resembles human
 linguistics and reasoning; as it considers all intermediate possibilities
 between binary values of YES and NO.
 The smart-home Rule-Based-Systems can then be expanded to work on Fuzzy
 If-else paradigm, example; “Turn off AC when room is at a comfortable temperatu
re” condition can be created that understands the comfortable temperature
 ranges of each individual.
 Here the input data first gets “Fuzzified” before being processed by an
 RBS Inference-Block, and the output may need to be “Defuzzified” prior
 to being translated into a Real-World action using .
 The system generates confidence-levels while making decisions.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Artificial Neural
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Networks Neural networks consist of a network of connected nodes that each
 can perform a few mathematical operations on some inputs-numbers.
 The uniqueness of this network is that it is highly interconnected so as
 to initiate the neurons connections in a human brain by cascading the inputs
 and outputs of the nodes.
 Every node or ‘artificial’ neuron assigns weights to the inputs that it
 receives from the previous nodes.
 The ANN consists of layers of such densely connected nodes and attempts
 to ‘tweak’ the assigned weights to match final outputs with an expected
 output which is known as ' learning’.
 Multiple parameters such as connection-types and activation functions are
 used to shape the layered-structure and connections of the ANN while applying
 different ‘rules’ influence its learning behaviour.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Connection types- Feed-Forward Networks, Recurrent-Neural Networks etc.
 Learning Rules: Hebbian rule, Perceptron learning, Back-Propagation etc.
 Activation functions : Sigmoidal, Hyperbolic-Tangent, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ANN can be used for activity classification, control of appliances, anomaly
 detection as well as dependable activity prediction in a smart home environment.
 In healthcare based smart home applications, ANN can be used for diagnose
 and monitor chronic illness as well as building medical decision systems.
 An example for these are found in (Khan et al.

), an MLP based framework was proposed to detect activity anomalies and
 identify repetitive tasks performed by residents by inferring data from
 environmental sensors and contact-switch-sensors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) used a Recurrent-Neural-Network that recognised activities such as sleeping,ea
ting, computer-usage and abnormal behaviour.
 The Online-Mode of operation ,which was facilitated by the Evolving Connectioni
st System (ECoS) framework, allows a deployed network to expand the number
 of sensors and thus the scope of activity detection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One-Pass Neural Network (OPNN) was employed by Li et al.
 (2008)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, for activity recognition that also ran online.
 The control dataset was room completely set up with sensors, and the participan
t residents were asked to list their activities to produce the Activities
 of Daily Living(ADLs) for the dataset.
 Detection of abnormal behaviours was done by creating an additional layer
 of the network.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Naive Bayes Classification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This classifier runs on simple probabilistic models based on Bayes’ theorem
 to make decisions.
 The classifier considers the inputs as independent variables and creates
 a probability boundary to take decisions.
 Due to being a probabilistic algorithm, NBC working is simple,traceable
 and gives a higher degree of control to the designer.
 NBC classifications have been employed in monitoring environments both
 with and without visual sensing-data, and reached an accuracy of 89% in
 2 independent studies.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hidden Markov Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are the lego blocks of computational sequence
 analysis.They are used for making probabilistic models of linear sequence
 'labeling' problems.They baseline is that we can build complex models just
 by drawing an intuitive picture.We imagine an HMM generating a sequence.
 For eg : Activities that can be linked together in a smart home Door Closed-AC
 switched on - Fridge open- Water taken - Light closed -House lift opened.

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Algorithm: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Visit a state - emit a residue from the state's probability distribution
 .
 Choose the next state to visit according to the state's transition probability
 distribution.
 Two strings of information are generated : underlying state path (the labels)
 and observed sequence each residue being emitted from one state in the
 state path.
 Based on the observed sequence, we infer the hidden state path or hidden
 Markov chain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<IMAGE>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In smart homes,the model can learn behavior patterns of users and provide
 services to residents automatically.
 As a result, different values of daily temperature sections, motion sensory
 activities and Wi-Fi based activity mapping are characterized as hidden
 variables, which guide user activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Conditional Random field
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conditional Random Fields are based on ‘Discriminative graphical Models’
 in contrast to above mentioned generative classifiers (Hidden Markov) and
 are used to find hidden states and transitions from the observed data sequences.
 CRF primarily works on only Conditional Probability calculations rather
 than Joint-Probability.
 It is also flexible enough to accept arbitrary and dependent relations
 between the sequences of observations.
 Unlike HMM, CRF also discards the assumption of independent variables,
 allowing it to capture virtually any relationships between an observation-varia
ble and the hidden-states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amongst the probabilistic models, CRF has been seen to achieve highest accuracy
 in activity recognition.
 CRF has outperformed HMM, NBC as well as the HSMM variant for multiple
 activity datasets(ADLs) in two separate comparative studies namely in Kasabov

Security systems for smart homes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the advent of smart homes, due to increased connectivity between a
 home system and many other large-scale systems, it is important that no
 malicious softwares enters the system and causes any kind of corruption.
 Let us consider this with the example of smart homes and smart grids.
 An energy aware household is expected to optimize the power budget used
 whilst also not slacking on comfort of the residents.
 This requires communication not only with the smart grid and the house,
 but also within all entities in the smart house.
 With all the communication depending on Information Technology, the system
 becomes vulnerable, which if exploited could not only damage the infrastructure
 of the home system but also the Smart Grid, which will have a large-scale
 impact.
 This also means that with the rise in Smart Grids, the role of Smart Homes
 and their residents becomes increasingly important.

6 Aspects of System Security 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following are the 6 aspects which are used while considering security
 of a system: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Confidentiality: only authorized personnel should have access to the data
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Integrity: assurance that the accuracy and consistency of the data is maintained.
 Any and all changes in the data are detected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Availability: Any network resource should be available to authorized entity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Authenticity: of the communicating parties involved i.e., all communicating
 parties must be validated and the information sent by them must indeed
 be sent by them 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Authorization: access control of each entity must be defined in the network.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Non repudiation: undeniable proof should exist for any claim of any entity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Impact Evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any security attack can be divided into categories based on whether the
 attack affects the system: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Passive: Here the threat is only attempting to take information from the
 system network, without affect its resources.
 This information could be valuable and be used in different ways to plan
 a more disastrous attack.
 In dealing with such attacks, one focuses on prevention rather than detection,
 as that can be very tough.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Active: Here the attack actively attempts to damage/affect the system network
 resources or operation.
 The most common amongst these attacks are masquerading, replay, message
 modification, denial of service and malicious software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now based on the impact of the attack to the system, the FIPS 199 standards
 can be used categorizing the attacks as Low level, Moderate level and High
 level, which in themselves fairly explain their damage extents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The architecture of the Smart home system is divided into internal and external
 systems, where, in this case, the Energy Service Interface (ESI) is in
 contact with the smart grid, and manages communication with the external
 system.
 And the Energy Management System (EMS) manages the internal system.

\begin_layout Subsection
Smart Home Attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Broadly categorizing, the major possible attacks possible on the Smart Home
 system are in the following ways, when considered with regards to communication
 with a Smart Grid: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SH1) Attacks threatening successful device energy-consumption reporting
 – When energy consumption of data is collected at very short intervals,
 eavesdropping on such an information could be used to infer a lot about
 the lifestyle of the residents, hence create a major risk to privacy.
 Needless to say, how this data can be used to plan a more severe attack
 on the resident (e.g.: burglary, kidnapping).
 In the same place if it is managed to send false, or replayed data to the
 EMS, a false extra financial burden can be created for the consumer.
 This could also be achieved by impersonating the EMS rather than only “piggybac
king” the network.
 (Generally low impact)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SH2) Attacks aiming Energy Import/Export signal at ESI - As the ESI is an
 entity in direct communication with the grid, any kind of message modification
 in the import export communication at a large scale could significantly
 impact the grid.
 Repudiation is also an important threat under this scenario since we expect
 the customer to be collaborating with an ESP for the management of his
 DERs due to his lack of experience.
 In such a case the customer should not be able to suggest that his ESP
 did not react when it should have/ or reacted when it shouldn’t have.
 (Generally moderate Impact) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SH3) Physical meter tampering/reversal or removal – Mischievous customers
 try to tamper with the meter to decrease the bill, which needs to be stopped.
 (Generally Low impact) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SH4) Attacks against remote home monitoring and control – These basically
 include attacks where-in an adversary may impersonate the customer to control
 the devices in different ways ( either switching on/off all devices or
 maybe modifying the messages).
 These attacks could have a low impact or may even be life threatening depending
 on the device(s) being abused.
 There is also the case of device impersonation where the commands sent
 remotely by the user are somehow directed to a device other than they were
 intended for.
 Therefore, Non-repudiation becomes a major factor in dealing with such
 attacks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SH5) Attacks aiming the request for energy usage data -Eaves dropping on
 the detailed bill of energy consumption by the user is again a direct attack
 on the users’ privacy, so this is another part where security protocols
 must be implemented.
 Table <1> gives a comprehensive list of the smart home security issues
 with respect to a smart grid.
 It can be used as a basis for analyzing issues possible whenever we include
 another system in our analysis.

Confidentiality: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cryptography is the most basic technique for achieving confidentiality.
 There are two types of cryptographic algorithms, Symmetric and Asymmetric.
 Symmetric algorithms (such as the standards AES and TDES) are expected
 to be used for the purpose of data encryption within the Smart Grid.
 Asymmetric algorithms on the other hand, (such as the approved RSA, DSA,
 ECDSA etc.) are expected to be used for the purpose of digitally signing
 messages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Privacy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the deployment of smart meters, it is clear that through the data collected
 by the smart meter a lot could be known about the consumer, thus causing
 fear.
 Privacy can be achieved by the following ways: Anonymization: The data
 and its source have their link removed before the data reaches its destination
 for computation.
 Trusted Aggregators: Trusted third party can handle aggregation of metering
 data and its forwarding to the smart grid utility.
 Homomorphic Encryption Perturbation Models : Introduction of noise of known
 distribution Verifiable Computation Models Data Obfuscation Techniques:
 : Battery-based approaches that aim to conceal the amount of energy consumed
 by a premise by buffering or releasing their energy load.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Integrity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to ensure integrity is using the cryptographic hashing techniques,
 which are designed for high integrity assurance in traditional networks.
 When using such techniques the sending side uses a hash function to compute
 the checksum of the message to be sent and attach it to the original message.
 Upon receiving the message, the receiving side applies the same hash function
 to the message and compares the resulting hash to the hash attached in
 the original message.
 Should the two hashes match, integrity is verified (i.e.
 it is proven that the message contents have not been altered in transit
 as a result of e.g.
 a message modification attack).

, present their own lightweight digital watermarking technique as a simple,
 low-cost and efficient way to ensure defense against false data injection
 attacks.
 Digital watermarking is a technique of embedding digital data inside real
 time meter readings, with the watermark carrying unique information about
 the owner of the reading.
 The purpose of the watermark is to validate the integrity of data.
 Watermarked data are sent from the meter to the utility through high speed
 unsecured networks that are prone to false data injection attacks.
 To ensure the successful detection of these attacks , the meters use low
 rate and secured channels to securely transmit the watermarks.

Security systems for smart homes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One major application of IOT in Homes is the power of monitoring the premises
 from anywhere.
 Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself
 kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and
 monitoring.
 Therefore, customers have a choice in systems where they can either monitor
 the house themselves or can have it monitored by third parties on payment
 basis.
 There’s also options in which one can have individual devices (like motion
 sensors, door locks, security cameras) rather than dedicated security systems
 which can be monitored via smartphones or tablets.
 As any general system would, the smart home security system can be connected
 to the Wi-Fi router of the house, giving access to customers remotely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ensuring Low Power Consumption : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a perfect world, all home security components would use the same wireless
 standard to communicate with the main hub, but factors such as power requiremen
ts, signal range, price, and size make it virtually impossible to settle
 on just one.
 For example, smaller components such as door/window sensors typically use
 Z-Wave or Zigbee technology because they don't require a lot of power and
 can be powered by smaller batteries.
 They also operate in a mesh topology and can help extend the range of networked
 devices.
 However, neither protocol provides the bandwidth that you get with Wi-Fi,
 which is why it is usually used in security cameras to provide smooth video
 streaming, and in other devices that require a fat pipe.
 Moreover, Z-Wave and Zigbee devices are connected and controlled using
 a hub, while Wi-Fi devices can be connected directly to your home network
 and controlled with an app.
 Finally, Z-Wave and Zigbee devices use AES 128 encryption, and since they
 operate in a closed system with a dedicated hub, they offer more security
 than Wi-Fi devices.

\begin_layout Subsection
A few Intelligent features : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With advancement in the intelligent IoT systems, more and more features
 are coming up.
 These features might be simple in nature but have a significant effect
 on the lives of people.
 For example, as soon as the smoke alarm goes off, all the doors should
 be unlocked.
 Or maybe the cameras could start recording as soon as a particular sensor
 goes off.
 Clearly, the first one will help in saving lives in case of fires and the
 second will simply save up the memory usage, electricity usage, therefore,
 giving monetary advantages to the customer.
 All these with the advantage of easy modifications in the system using
 smartphones, give the users a lavish security system at a minimal cost.
 Another important feature to be noticed is the Video Doorbell which offers
 an easy way to see who is at your door without having to open or even get
 close to the door.
 These devices connect to your Wi-Fi network and will send an alert when
 someone approaches your doorway.
 They'll record video when the doorbell is pressed or when motion is detected,
 and usually offer two-way audio communication that allows you to speak
 with the visitor from anywhere via your phone.
 Another famous technology to be looked at here is, IFTTT.
 IFTTT derives its name from the programming conditional statement “if this,
 then that.” What the company provides is a software platform that connects
 apps, devices and services from different developers in order to trigger
 one or more automations involving those apps, devices and services.
 This can allow the user to not necessarily go for a particular company
 for all the components needed in the system.
 The users as per their requirements can go for door locks, motion sensors,
 smoke detector systems of different companies and use IFTTT to bring them
 to a common platform.
 This especially comes in handy to people trying to install the system on
 their own.
 So,many companies also give the IFTTT support

Energy management solutions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using energy efficiently in smart homes saves money, enhances sustainability
 and reduces carbon footprint at large.
 As a result, the need for intelligent energy management is on the rise
 for smart homes and smart cities in general.
 The lack of low cost, low maintenance and easy to deploy technology has
 limited a large-scale deployment of such systems.
 The large amount of data collected throughout different cities of a country
 presents multiple challenges in data storage, organization, and analysis.
 Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Big Data are the most sought out
 solutions to solve these challenges.
 IoT technologies can provide a ubiquitous computing platform to sense,
 monitor and control household appliances energy consumption on a large
 scale.
 This data is collected with the help of many different wireless sensors
 installed in residential power monitoring units.
 Similarly, Big Data technology can be utilized to collect and analyze large
 amounts of data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Data analytics on this data using a business intelligence (BI) platform
 plays an essential role in energy management decisions for homeowners and
 the utility alike.
 The data can be monitored, collected and analyzed using predictive analysis
 and advanced methods to actionable information in reports, graphs and charts.
 Thus, this analyzed data in real-time can aid homeowners, utilities, and
 utility eco-systems providers to gain significant insights into smart homes'
 energy consumption.
 The energy service providers can use the power consumption data available
 with an analytics engine to provide flexible and on-demand supply with
 appropriate energy marketing strategies.
 Being aware of their consumption behaviour and having a close interaction
 with the electricity utilities can adjust and optimize home users power
 consumption and reduce their electricity bills.

Energy Harvesting and Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to have an effective cost-saving system, it is necessary to monitor
 and control the operation of residential loads depending on the aggregate
 power consumption over the desired period, the peak power consumption,
 the effect of weather/atmospheric conditions and consumption slab rates.
 This is where the combination of IoT technology, Big Data analytics and
 BI comes into play for implementing energy management solutions on a local
 and national scale.
 Finally, as an additional advantage, IoT also enables seamless remote access
 control of home devices where the customers get online access to the ON/OFF
 usage pattern of in-home appliances via a personal computer or a mobile
 phone.

, where they have developed a home system that essentially programs itself
 by observing the lifestyle and desires of the inhabitants, and learning
 to anticipate and accommodate their needs.The system controls basic residential
 comfort systems-air heating, lighting, ventilation, and water heating.
 They call the system ACHE.
 ACHE has two objectives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One is anticipation of inhabitants needs.
 Lighting, air temperature, and ventilation should be maintained to the
 inhabitants comfort; hot water should be available on demand.
 When inhabitants manually adjust environmental setpoints, it is an indication
 that their needs have not been satisfied and will serve as a training signal
 for ACHE.
 If ACHE can learn to anticipate needs, manual control of the environment
 will be avoided.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The second objective of ACHE is energy conservation.
 Lights should be set to the minimum intensity required; hot water should
 be maintained at the minimum temperature needed to satisfy the demand;
 only rooms that are likely to be occupied in the near future should be
 heated; when several options exist to heat a room , the alternative minimizing
 expected energy consumption should be selected.

 proposes a distributed optimization algorithm for scheduling the energy
 consumption of multiple smart homes.
 In the proposed approach, home energy management’s centralized optimization
 problem is split into a two-level optimization problem, one corresponding
 to the local home energy management system (LHEMS) and the global home
 energy management system (GHEMS) at the second level.
 Controllable household appliances (like an air conditioner, washing machine)
 are listed in the LHEMS within users preferred appliance scheduling and
 comfort level while the energy storage system (ESS) and power trading between
 households are listed in the GHEMS.
 In a simulation study, the proposed distributed algorithm shows almost
 equivalent performance to the centralized algorithm in terms of the electricity
 cost and the consumer’s comfort level.
 The impact of different network topologies on the proposed algorithm was
 also analyzed.
 The result provides insight into the selection of the optimal network arrangeme
nt to achieve electricity cost saving.
