Security systems for smart homes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the advent of smart homes, due to increased connectivity between a
 home system and many other large-scale systems, it is important that no
 malicious softwares enters the system and causes any kind of corruption.
 Let us consider this with the example of smart homes and smart grids.
 An energy aware household is expected to optimize the power budget used
 whilst also not slacking on comfort of the residents.
 This requires communication not only with the smart grid and the house,
 but also within all entities in the smart house.
 With all the communication depending on Information Technology, the system
 becomes vulnerable, which if exploited could not only damage the infrastructure
 of the home system but also the Smart Grid, which will have a large-scale
 impact.
 This also means that with the rise in Smart Grids, the role of Smart Homes
 and their residents becomes increasingly important.

\begin_layout Subsection
6 Aspects of System Security 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following are the 6 aspects which are used while considering security
 of a system: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Confidentiality: only authorized personnel should have access to the data
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Integrity: assurance that the accuracy and consistency of the data is maintained.
 Any and all changes in the data are detected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Availability: Any network resource should be available to authorized entity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Authenticity: of the communicating parties involved i.e., all communicating
 parties must be validated and the information sent by them must indeed
 be sent by them 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Authorization: access control of each entity must be defined in the network.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Non repudiation: undeniable proof should exist for any claim of any entity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Impact Evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any security attack can be divided into categories based on whether the
 attack affects the system: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Passive: Here the threat is only attempting to take information from the
 system network, without affect its resources.
 This information could be valuable and be used in different ways to plan
 a more disastrous attack.
 In dealing with such attacks, one focuses on prevention rather than detection,
 as that can be very tough.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Active: Here the attack actively attempts to damage/affect the system network
 resources or operation.
 The most common amongst these attacks are masquerading, replay, message
 modification, denial of service and malicious software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now based on the impact of the attack to the system, the FIPS 199 standards
 can be used categorizing the attacks as Low level, Moderate level and High
 level, which in themselves fairly explain their damage extents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The architecture of the Smart home system is divided into internal and external
 systems, where, in this case, the Energy Service Interface (ESI) is in
 contact with the smart grid, and manages communication with the external
 system.
 And the Energy Management System (EMS) manages the internal system.

\begin_layout Subsection
Smart Home Attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Broadly categorizing, the major possible attacks possible on the Smart Home
 system are in the following ways, when considered with regards to communication
 with a Smart Grid: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SH1) Attacks threatening successful device energy-consumption reporting
 – When energy consumption of data is collected at very short intervals,
 eavesdropping on such an information could be used to infer a lot about
 the lifestyle of the residents, hence create a major risk to privacy.
 Needless to say, how this data can be used to plan a more severe attack
 on the resident (e.g.: burglary, kidnapping).
 In the same place if it is managed to send false, or replayed data to the
 EMS, a false extra financial burden can be created for the consumer.
 This could also be achieved by impersonating the EMS rather than only “piggybac
king” the network.
 (Generally low impact)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SH2) Attacks aiming Energy Import/Export signal at ESI - As the ESI is an
 entity in direct communication with the grid, any kind of message modification
 in the import export communication at a large scale could significantly
 impact the grid.
 Repudiation is also an important threat under this scenario since we expect
 the customer to be collaborating with an ESP for the management of his
 DERs due to his lack of experience.
 In such a case the customer should not be able to suggest that his ESP
 did not react when it should have/ or reacted when it shouldn’t have.
 (Generally moderate Impact) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SH3) Physical meter tampering/reversal or removal – Mischievous customers
 try to tamper with the meter to decrease the bill, which needs to be stopped.
 (Generally Low impact) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SH4) Attacks against remote home monitoring and control – These basically
 include attacks where-in an adversary may impersonate the customer to control
 the devices in different ways ( either switching on/off all devices or
 maybe modifying the messages).
 These attacks could have a low impact or may even be life threatening depending
 on the device(s) being abused.
 There is also the case of device impersonation where the commands sent
 remotely by the user are somehow directed to a device other than they were
 intended for.
 Therefore, Non-repudiation becomes a major factor in dealing with such
 attacks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SH5) Attacks aiming the request for energy usage data -Eaves dropping on
 the detailed bill of energy consumption by the user is again a direct attack
 on the users’ privacy, so this is another part where security protocols
 must be implemented.
 Table <1> gives a comprehensive list of the smart home security issues
 with respect to a smart grid.
 It can be used as a basis for analyzing issues possible whenever we include
 another system in our analysis.

Security countermeasures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Confidentiality: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cryptography is the most basic technique for achieving confidentiality.
 There are two types of cryptographic algorithms, Symmetric and Asymmetric.
 Symmetric algorithms (such as the standards AES and TDES) are expected
 to be used for the purpose of data encryption within the Smart Grid.
 Asymmetric algorithms on the other hand, (such as the approved RSA, DSA,
 ECDSA etc.) are expected to be used for the purpose of digitally signing
 messages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Privacy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the deployment of smart meters, it is clear that through the data collected
 by the smart meter a lot could be known about the consumer, thus causing
 fear.
 Privacy can be achieved by the following ways: Anonymization: The data
 and its source have their link removed before the data reaches its destination
 for computation.
 Trusted Aggregators: Trusted third party can handle aggregation of metering
 data and its forwarding to the smart grid utility.
 Homomorphic Encryption Perturbation Models : Introduction of noise of known
 distribution Verifiable Computation Models Data Obfuscation Techniques:
 : Battery-based approaches that aim to conceal the amount of energy consumed
 by a premise by buffering or releasing their energy load.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Integrity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to ensure integrity is using the cryptographic hashing techniques,
 which are designed for high integrity assurance in traditional networks.
 When using such techniques the sending side uses a hash function to compute
 the checksum of the message to be sent and attach it to the original message.
 Upon receiving the message, the receiving side applies the same hash function
 to the message and compares the resulting hash to the hash attached in
 the original message.
 Should the two hashes match, integrity is verified (i.e.
 it is proven that the message contents have not been altered in transit
 as a result of e.g.
 a message modification attack).

, present their own lightweight digital watermarking technique as a simple,
 low-cost and efficient way to ensure defense against false data injection
 attacks.
 Digital watermarking is a technique of embedding digital data inside real
 time meter readings, with the watermark carrying unique information about
 the owner of the reading.
 The purpose of the watermark is to validate the integrity of data.
 Watermarked data are sent from the meter to the utility through high speed
 unsecured networks that are prone to false data injection attacks.
 To ensure the successful detection of these attacks , the meters use low
 rate and secured channels to securely transmit the watermarks.
 The utility thus receives both the watermarks and the watermarked data,
 in order to correlate them and detect false data injection attacks Furthemore,
 Load Profiling, Timestamps, Sequence Numbers, etc are other techniques
 that can be used to ensure high integrity assurance.

Smart Home Security Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One major application of IOT in Homes is the power of monitoring the premises
 from anywhere.
 Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself
 kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and
 monitoring.
 Therefore, customers have a choice in systems where they can either monitor
 the house themselves or can have it monitored by third parties on payment
 basis.
 There’s also options in which one can have individual devices (like motion
 sensors, door locks, security cameras) rather than dedicated security systems
 which can be monitored via smartphones or tablets.
 As any general system would, the smart home security system can be connected
 to the Wi-Fi router of the house, giving access to customers remotely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Ensuring Low Power Consumption : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a perfect world, all home security components would use the same wireless
 standard to communicate with the main hub, but factors such as power requiremen
ts, signal range, price, and size make it virtually impossible to settle
 on just one.
 For example, smaller components such as door/window sensors typically use
 Z-Wave or Zigbee technology because they don't require a lot of power and
 can be powered by smaller batteries.
 They also operate in a mesh topology and can help extend the range of networked
 devices.
 However, neither protocol provides the bandwidth that you get with Wi-Fi,
 which is why it is usually used in security cameras to provide smooth video
 streaming, and in other devices that require a fat pipe.
 Moreover, Z-Wave and Zigbee devices are connected and controlled using
 a hub, while Wi-Fi devices can be connected directly to your home network
 and controlled with an app.
 Finally, Z-Wave and Zigbee devices use AES 128 encryption, and since they
 operate in a closed system with a dedicated hub, they offer more security
 than Wi-Fi devices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
A few Intelligent features : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With advancement in the intelligent IoT systems, more and more features
 are coming up.
 These features might be simple in nature but have a significant effect
 on the lives of people.
 For example, as soon as the smoke alarm goes off, all the doors should
 be unlocked.
 Or maybe the cameras could start recording as soon as a particular sensor
 goes off.
 Clearly, the first one will help in saving lives in case of fires and the
 second will simply save up the memory usage, electricity usage, therefore,
 giving monetary advantages to the customer.
 All these with the advantage of easy modifications in the system using
 smartphones, give the users a lavish security system at a minimal cost.
 Another important feature to be noticed is the Video Doorbell which offers
 an easy way to see who is at your door without having to open or even get
 close to the door.
 These devices connect to your Wi-Fi network and will send an alert when
 someone approaches your doorway.
 They'll record video when the doorbell is pressed or when motion is detected,
 and usually offer two-way audio communication that allows you to speak
 with the visitor from anywhere via your phone.
 Another famous technology to be looked at here is, IFTTT.
 IFTTT derives its name from the programming conditional statement “if this,
 then that.” What the company provides is a software platform that connects
 apps, devices and services from different developers in order to trigger
 one or more automations involving those apps, devices and services.
 This can allow the user to not necessarily go for a particular company
 for all the components needed in the system.
 The users as per their requirements can go for door locks, motion sensors,
 smoke detector systems of different companies and use IFTTT to bring them
 to a common platform.
 This especially comes in handy to people trying to install the system on
 their own.
 So,many companies also give the IFTTT support

Energy management solutions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using energy efficiently in smart homes saves money, enhances sustainability
 and reduces carbon footprint at large.
 As a result, the need for smart energy management is on the rise for smart
 homes and for smart cities in general.
 However, the lack of low cost, easy to deploy, and low maintenance technology
 has somewhat limited a large-scale deployment of such systems.
 The sheer quantity of data collected throughout different cities of a country
 presents multiple challenges in data storage, organization, and analysis.
 Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Big Data are natural candidates
 to address these challenges.
 IoT technologies can provide a ubiquitous computing platform to sense,
 monitor and control the household appliances energy consumption on a large
 scale.
 This data is collected using many different wireless sensors installed
 in residential units.
 Similarly, Big Data technology can be utilized to collect and analyze large
 amounts of data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "intro"

\end_inset

.
 Data analytics on this data using business intelligence (BI) platform plays
 an essential role in energy management decisions for homeowners and the
 utility alike.
 The data can be monitored, collected and analyzed using predictive analysis
 and advanced methods to actionable information in the form of reports,
 graphs and charts.
 Thus, this analyzed data in real-time can aid home owners, utilities and
 utility eco-systems providers to gain significant insights on energy consumptio
n of smart homes.
 The energy service providers can use the power consumption data available
 with analytics engine to provide flexible and on-demand supply with appropriate
 energy marketing strategies.
 The consumers, being aware of their consumption behavior and having a close
 interaction with the electricity utilities, can adjust and optimize their
 power consumption and reduce their electricity bills.

Energy Harvesting and Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to have an effective cost saving system, it is important to monitor
 and control the operation of residential loads depending on the aggregate
 power consumption over desired period, the peak power consumption, the
 effect of weather/atmospheric conditions and consumption slab rates.
 This is where the combination of IoT technology, Big Data analytics and
 BI comes into play for implementing energy management solutions on a local
 and national scale.
 Finally, as an additional advantage, the use of IoT also enables seamless
 remote access control of home devices where the customers get online access
 to the ON/OFF usage pattern of in home appliances via a personal computer
 or a mobile phone.

 This system also provides a detail analysis on energy management which
 has been developed by measuring power consumption throughout a year in

, where they have developed a home system that essentially programs itself
 by observing the lifestyle and desires of the inhabitants, and learning
 to anticipate and accommodate their needs.The system controls basic residential
 comfort systems-air heating, lighting, ventilation, and water heating.
 They call the system ACHE.
 ACHE has two objectives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One is anticipation of inhabitants needs.
 Lighting, air temperature, and ventilation should be maintained to the
 inhabitants comfort; hot water should be available on demand.
 When inhabitants manually adjust environmental setpoints, it is an indication
 that their needs have not been satisfied and will serve as a training signal
 for ACHE.
 If ACHE can learn to anticipate needs, manual control of the environment
 will be avoided.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The second objective of ACHE is energy conservation.
 Lights should be set to the minimum intensity required; hot water should
 be maintained at the minimum temperature needed to satisfy the demand;
 only rooms that are likely to be occupied in the near future should be
 heated; when several options exist to heat a room , the alternative minimizing
 expected energy consumption should be selected.
\end_layout

 proposes a distributed optimization algorithm for scheduling the energy
 consumption of multiple smart homes with distributed energy resources.
 In the proposed approach, the centralized optimization problem for home
 energy management is decomposed into a two-level optimization problem,
 corresponding to the local home energy management system (LHEMS) at the
 first level and the global home energy management system (GHEMS) at the
 second level.
 The controllable household appliances (e.g., air conditioner, washing machine)
 are scheduled in the LHEMS within consumer’s preferred appliance scheduling
 and comfort level while the energy storage system (ESS) and power trading
 between households are scheduled in the GHEMS.
 In the simulation study, the proposed distributed algorithm shows almost
 equivalent performance to the centralized algorithm in terms of the electricity
 cost and the consumer’s comfort level.
 The impact of different network topologies on the proposed algorithm is
 also analyzed, and the result provides insight into the selection of the
 optimal network configuration in view of the consumer’s electricity cost
 saving.
