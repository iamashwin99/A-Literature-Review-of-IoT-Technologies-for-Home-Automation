	abstract = {Thanks to the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT), the research and the implementation of home automation are getting more popular because the IoT holds promise for making homes smarter through wireless technologies. There is a main requirement that make a wireless protocol ideal for use in the IoT, that is the energy efficiency. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has a high potential in becoming an important technology for the IoT in low power, low cost, small devices. However, specific techniques can be used in such a way as to further reduce the energy consumption of BLE. To this end, this paper proposes a fuzzy logic based mechanism that determine the sleeping time of field devices in a home automation environment based on BLE. The proposed FLC determines the sleeping time of field devices according to the battery level and to the ratio of Throughput to Workload (Th/Wl). Simulation results reveal that using the proposed approach the device lifetime is increased by 30\% with respect to the use of fixed sleeping time.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we first introduce a general architecture of an energy management system in a home area network based on a smart grid. Then, we propose an efficient scheduling method for home power usage. The home gateway (HG) receives the demand response (DR) information indicating the real-time electricity price, which is transferred to an energy management controller (EMC). Referring to the DR, the EMC achieves an optimal power scheduling scheme, which is delivered to each electric appliance by the HG. Accordingly, all appliances in the home operate automatically in the most cost-effective way possible. In our research, to avoid the high peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of power, we combine the real-time pricing model with the inclining block rate model. By adopting this combined pricing model, our proposed power scheduling method effectively reduces both the electricity cost and the PAR, ultimately strengthening the stability of the entire electricity system.},

Then, we propose an energy scheduler where the user may select to relax the temperature constraints to save more energy.

@article{int10,
	abstract = {Energy management of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is a primary concern in building projects, since the energy consumption in electricity has the highest percentage in HVAC among all building services installations and electric appliances. Without sacrifice of thermal comfort, to reset the suitable operating parameters, such as the chilled water temperature and supply air temperature, would have energy saving with immediate effect. For the typical commercial building projects, it is not difficult to acquire the reference settings for efficient operation. However, for some special projects, due to the specific design and control of the HVAC system, conventional settings may not be necessarily energy-efficient in daily operation. In this paper, the simulation-optimization approach was proposed for the effective energy management of HVAC system. Due to the complicated interrelationship of the entire HVAC system, which commonly includes the water side and air side systems, it is necessary to suggest optimum settings for different operations in response to the dynamic cooling loads and changing weather conditions throughout a year. A metaheuristic simulation--EP (evolutionary programming) coupling approach was developed using evolutionary programming, which can effectively handle the discrete, non-linear and highly constrained optimization problems, such as those related to HVAC systems. The effectiveness of this simulation--EP coupling suite was demonstrated through the establishment of a monthly optimum reset scheme for both the chilled water and supply air temperatures of the HVAC installations of a local project. This reset scheme would have a saving potential of about 7\% as compared to the existing operational settings, without any extra cost.},

The realization of next generation ubiquitous and pervasive healthcare systems will be a challenging task, as these systems are likely to involve a complex structure. Such systems will consist of various devices, ranging from resource-constrained sensors and actuators to complex multimedia devices, supporting time critical applications. This is further compounded by cultural and socio-economical factors that must be addressed for next generation healthcare systems to be widely diffused and used. In this study, the requirements for a vital sign monitoring solution space is derived and mPHASiS is developed based on these requirements. mPHASiS is an end to end solution not only providing sensor networking and vital sign monitoring but also closing the loop by signaling alert messages to the caregiver and allowing pervasive access to vital signs of a patient using smartphones over a heterogeneous network. A role based access control mechanism is developed to limit access to sensitive data. The end to end delay and delay variations for both vital sign data collection and pervasive access are analyzed. mPHASiS is developed as a complementary solution augmenting functionality of a hospital information system and can be loosely couple with the hospital information system using webservices.},

As an expression of intelligence, adaptivity is a distinguishing quality of any system that is able to learn and to adjust itself in a flexible manner to new environmental conditions and such ability ensures self-correction over time as new events happen, new input becomes available, or new operational conditions occur. This requires self-monitoring of the performance in an ever-changing environment. The relevance of adaptivity is established in numerous domains and by versatile real-world applications. The present paper presents an incremental fuzzy rule-based system for classification purposes. Relying on fuzzy min--max neural networks, the paper explains how fuzzy rules can be continuously online generated to meet the requirements of non-stationary dynamic environments, where data arrives over long periods of time. The approach proposed to deal with an ambient intelligence application. The simulation results show its effectiveness in dealing with dynamic situations and its performance when compared with existing approaches.},

Recognizing the activities an elderly person who lives alone performs, and identifying potential problems from the detected activities is a very active topic of research. However, current approaches do not take into account the fact that the way an activity is performed by a person evolves over time and therefore activities are identified by mapping them to a static model. In this work we describe and evaluate an approach for online classifying based on Evolving Fuzzy Systems (EFS): activities are described by a model that evolves over time, according to the changes observed in the way an activity is performed. These classifiers have been evaluated on three datasets obtained from real home settings, achieving a good recognition performance, at a confidence interval of 95\%, compared with well know probabilistic models in terms of F-Measure, but improving their performance in terms of online capabilities and ability to adapt to the evolving ways in which activities are carried out.},

	abstract = {The present paper proposes the application of decision trees to model activities of daily living in a multi-resident context. An extension of ID5R, called E-ID5R, is proposed. It augments the leaf nodes and allows such nodes to be multi-labeled. E-ID5R induces a decision tree incrementally to accommodate new instances and new activities as they become available over time. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, the ARAS dataset which is a real-world multi-resident dataset stemming from two houses is used. E-ID5R performs differently on activities of both houses.},

@inproceedings{m20,
	abstract = {In this work, a system for recognizing activities in the home setting using a set of small and simple state-change sensors is introduced. The sensors are designed to be ``tape on and forget'' devices that can be quickly and ubiquitously installed in home environments. The proposed sensing system presents an alternative to sensors that are sometimes perceived as invasive, such as cameras and microphones. Unlike prior work, the system has been deployed in multiple residential environments with non-researcher occupants. Preliminary results on a small dataset show that it is possible to recognize activities of interest to medical professionals such as toileting, bathing, and grooming with detection accuracies ranging from 25{\%} to 89{\%} depending on the evaluation criteria used.},
